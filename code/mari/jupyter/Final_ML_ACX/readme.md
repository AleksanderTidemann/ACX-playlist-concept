This folder contains two jupyter notebook files. ACX_algorithm.ipynb is the algorithm that was used on the Emotify dataset to classify emotion annotaions. ACX_input.ipynb is the notebook where the user can classify new content via the exported algorithm. New music tracks should be placed in the folder "New_tracks", and follow the same structure as the example folder "New_tracks/input_files1/tracks". E.g. If you want to classify 300 new songs, you should create a new folder within the New_tracks folder, called input_files2, and place the files in input_files2/tracks. Then, the folder New_tracks will contain two folders: input_files1 and input_files2.

Enjoy!
